        <h3>My bio</h3>
        <p>
          My academic career began immediately after high school, but absent direction, I felt like I was doomed to remain a perpetual student. I studied various disciplines which very extremely helpful to extend my worldview and better understand the mechanics of our society. History, sociology, pedagogy, economics, even Latin language. My interests encompassed anatomy and physiology, mathematics, and finally computer science. As a competing athlete, I loved the challenge and was instantly addicted to the overwhelming abundance of information to be consumed. In the first year of my newly chosen major I learned Python, SQL, Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS and glimpsed into JAVA Script. I acquired basic knowledge in Networking and Cyber Security as well as machines’ hardware.  My modest achievements are laid out on the next page of this site for your entertainment and critique. Web design challenged and fascinated me, and as I dove further into the rabbit hole,  more was reveled to me. Jquery, SCSS, REACT… Those are not the chants in the Pentecostal church, but the tools with which we shall battle the invariably superior machines in the future. Or, perhaps I read too much science fiction. In any case, once I acquire outdoor surviving skills I shall be fully prepared for the ambiguous future. Will you?
